  This is caffe implementation of ShuffleNet, For details, please read the original paper "ShuffleNet: An Extremely Efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Mobile Devices" by Xiangyu Zhang et. al. 2017. This code is based on camel007's implementation(https://github.com/camel007/Caffe-ShuffleNet), but I recode the cuda file for acceleration.
